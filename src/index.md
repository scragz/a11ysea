## Building Accessible Products for Real People

Accessibility starts with understanding. Too often, design focuses on an “average” user, leaving out the needs of individuals from marginalized communities—people with disabilities, unique access requirements, or other life circumstances that are easy to overlook.

These personas are crafted to help shift that perspective. By using them to guide your user stories, you’re taking an intentional step toward inclusive design, making sure that every feature, flow, and interaction considers those who are often left out.

### Use These Personas to Design with Empathy

Explore these profiles as a reminder of the real diversity in how people interact with technology. They’re here to help you think beyond assumptions, to prioritize accessibility, and ultimately, to create products that serve everyone.

### Engage with Custom GPTs for Insights

Each persona has its own custom GPT, allowing you to interact directly with them as if they were using your product. These tailored conversations offer firsthand insights into accessibility challenges and highlight the real impact of inclusive design choices, helping you create a product that truly supports all users.
